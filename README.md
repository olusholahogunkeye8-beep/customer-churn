Customer Churn Analysis & Insights
🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn directly affects revenue and long-term business growth.
The objective of this project is to analyze customer data to identify key factors contributing to churn and provide data-driven insights that can support customer retention strategies.

🎯 Project Objectives

Identify patterns and trends associated with customer churn

Understand customer behavior across different segments

Provide actionable insights to reduce churn

Demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills using Python and SQL

📁 Dataset

Source: Public customer churn dataset

Description: The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, tenure, billing information, and churn labels.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Database: SQL (for querying and aggregation)

Visualization: Matplotlib

🔍 Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing values and inconsistencies

Converted data types for accurate analysis

Removed duplicates and standardized variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed churn distribution

Examined relationships between churn and customer tenure

Compared churn rates across customer segments

Data Visualization

Created visualizations to highlight churn patterns

Used charts to communicate insights clearly

Insight Generation

Identified high-risk churn segments

Highlighted factors influencing customer churn

📈 Key Insights

Customers with short tenure showed significantly higher churn rates

Service usage patterns strongly influenced churn behavior

Certain customer segments require targeted retention strategies

Early customer engagement plays a critical role in retention

📌 Business Recommendations
